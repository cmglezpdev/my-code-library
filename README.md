My competitive programming code library.

It has solved exercises of some Online Judges and algorithms and techniques that I use.
The library is under construction, so it has very few algorithms and solved exercises.

I have some experience in CP, but due to almost two years without practicing or solving exercises, I have decided to start from scratch little by little.
